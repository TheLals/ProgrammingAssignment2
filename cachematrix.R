## This function creates a special "matrix" object that cache its inverse
## 

## makeCacheMatrix function creates and returs a 'matrix'

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## The cachesolve function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. 
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then 
## cacheSolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
